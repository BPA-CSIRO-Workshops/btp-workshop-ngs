However, we'll probably provide an example\r\nrepository showing how to use the various features of this style file. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nInstalling the LateX Environment\r\n================================\r\nIn order to build a PDF from LaTeX source files. You'll first need to install LaTeX\r\nand some other LaTeX packages to get this style file to work.\r\n\r\nWe provide a script (`install_latex.sh`) which downloads and installs LaTeX,\r\nas well as all the packages required for this style. Simply clone this\r\nrepository and run that script and you should have LaTeX ready to go in just\r\na few minutes:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/BioplatformsAustralia/LaTeX-style.git\r\ncd LaTeX-style.git\r\nsudo ./install_latex.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the above script will download LaTeX packages from the default CTAN mirror.\r\nYou will benefit from faster downloads and a quicker install if you use a mirror closer\r\nto where you are. To change the mirror, simply set the environmental variable\r\n`CTAN_MIRROR_URL` to point to your favourite CTAN mirror (http://ctan.org/mirrors):\r\n```bash\r\nexport CTAN_MIRROR_URL='http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN'\r\nsudo -E ./install_latex.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThis style was originally designed for the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)\r\nhands-on workshop developed by Bioplatforms Australia (BPA), CSIRO\r\nBioinformatics Core and the EBI. It was written predominantly by Nathan S.\r\nWatson-Haigh.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThe contents of this repository are released under the Creative Commons\r\nAttribution 3.0 Unported License.
