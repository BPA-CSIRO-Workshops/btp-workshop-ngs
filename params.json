To make this\r\neasy we have provided a script to do this:\r\n```bash\r\ncd developers\r\nsudo ./texlive_install.sh\r\ncd ../\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondly, you need to add the location of the texlive binary's to your PATH. If\r\nyou installed texlive using the supplied script, the following should work:\r\n```bash\r\nexport PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to build the PDFs using the supplied Makefile:\r\n```bash\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThis style was originally designed for the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)\r\nhands-on workshop developed by Bioplatforms Australia (BPA), CSIRO\r\nBioinformatics Core and the EBI. It was written predominantly by Nathan S.\r\nWatson-Haigh.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThe contents of this repository are released under the Creative Commons\r\nAttribution 3.0 Unported License.
