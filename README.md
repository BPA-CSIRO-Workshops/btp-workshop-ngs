Homepage and PDFs
=================
You can access the homepage, and up-to-date PDFs, for this project at
http://bpa-csiro-workshops.github.io/btp-workshop-ngs.

Purpose
=======
This repository contains style information for use with LaTeX to generate
consistently styled handout documents for use in hands-on bioinformatics
training workshops.

You can find full details of what this repository is all about how to use it at:
http://BPA-CSIRO-Workshops.github.io/handout-template/

Building PDFs from LaTeX Source
===============================
First you need to install texlive and a bunch of LaTeX packages. To make this
easy we have provided a script to do this:
```bash
cd developers
sudo ./texlive_install.sh
cd ../
```

Secondly, you need to add the location of the texlive binary's to your PATH. If
you installed texlive using the supplied script, the following should work:
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
```

Now you're ready to build the PDFs using the supplied Makefile:
```bash
make
```

This style was originally designed for the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
hands-on workshop developed by Bioplatforms Australia (BPA), CSIRO
Bioinformatics Core and the EBI. It was written predominantly by Nathan S.
Watson-Haigh.
