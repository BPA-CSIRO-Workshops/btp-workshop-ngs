# Welcome to the Introduction to NGS Workshop
<br>

The Introduction to NGS Data Analysis is a three-day, hands-on workshop that offers attendees a basic understanding of NGS data analysis workflows. The workshop provides hands-on computational experience in analysis of NGS data using common analytical approaches for ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq data and de novo genome assembly.

## Workshop Content
Topics covered by this workshop include:
* An introduction to the command line interface and NGS file formats
* Assessment of the quality of NGS sequence reads
* Sequence alignment algorithms
* Basic ChIP-Seq analysis
* Basic RNA-Seq analysis
* Short and long read de novo genome assembly

This workshop will be delivered using a mixture of lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and open discussions.
